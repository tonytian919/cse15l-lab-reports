### Part-II: Lab-7 ###
*Time used:*

Start in Visual Studio Code: 23 mins

Start in ssh session: 20 mins

**Q:** Which of these two styles would you prefer using if you had to work on a program that you were running remotely, and why?

**A:** I prefer using the first one, which is starting in VSC. Although we need some time to login to the remote session, I prefer editing the code in the VSC. 

**Q:** What about the project or task might factor into your decision one way or another?

**A:** For me, it actually depends. If the project or task is simple and I can come up with the ideas easily, I would use ssh session. If I need to revise the code some times, I prefer using VSC for its code editing convinence. However, If I need to test and revise my work over and over again, I would stay in remote session since logining reversely at this time costs a lot of time.
